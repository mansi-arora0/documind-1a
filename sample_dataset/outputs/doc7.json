      "text": "Space missions depend significantly on real-time telemetry data to assess the health and performance of spacecraft. Given the intricate and crucial nature of these missions, any irregularity in the telemetry data can lead to serious repercussions, potentially threatening the success of the mission. Conventional anomaly detection methods usually necessitate extensive analysis on the ground, which may not be practical for deep space missions due to communication delays and restricted bandwidth. Furthermore, in human space missions where rapid decisions are required, AI tools can assist astronauts in analyzing and drawing relevant conclusions from onboard telemetry data. Additionally, the computational resources available on spacecraft are limited, creating hurdles for implementing advanced anomaly detection algorithms. Consequently, there is an urgent need to create an AI model that can effectively monitor telemetry data, identify anomalies in real-time, and function within the strict limitations of onboard computational capabilities. ●  Currently, ISRO uses rule-based threshold monitoring (e.g., an alert if battery voltage < 3.6V) ●  This leads to false alarms or misses slow-developing failures (e.g., gradual temperature rise). ●  AI can learn patterns in telemetry data and predict failures before they occur, and prevent minor errors from leading to catastrophic ones, increasing chances of mission success",

      "text": "monitoring onboard spacecraft, specifically addressing the challenges of computational constraints in space mission environments. ●  Reduce computational complexity and model size while maintaining high detection accuracy, focusing on lightweight AI programming techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. ●  Enhance spacecraft autonomy by minimizing reliance on ground-based monitoring and enabling real-time decision-making despite limited onboard resources. ●  Implement and test the AI model on embedded hardware, simulating the resource-constrained environments typical in space missions. ●  Contribute to ISRO’s advancements in autonomous spacecraft operations, ensuring more efficient, safe, and sustainable space missions, especially in deep-space and human spaceflight missions. ISRO currently relies on predefined thresholds and expert-driven analysis for telemetry monitoring. This has three major limitations: 1.  Limited Prediction Capabilities: Cannot foresee failures in advance, leading to reactive maintenance rather than proactive intervention. 2.  Data Overload: Continuous telemetry transmission overloads ground-based data processing centers. 3.  Lack of Real-Time Autonomy: Reliance on Earth-based monitoring increases decision-making delays, which is problematic for deep-space missions like Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan, and future Gaganyaan missions. 4.  In past missions, unexpected temperature fluctuations in spacecraft components have led to system malfunctions. A lightweight AI model could predict temperature anomalies in advance and suggest corrective actions, preventing component damage. ●  NASA has implemented Deep Learning for telemetry data analysis in its Remote Agent Experiment (RAX).",

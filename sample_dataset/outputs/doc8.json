Cloud Computing is also referred to as Internet- based computing. In this data is stored over the internet. The data that is stored can be files, images, documents etc. The following are some of the operations that can be performed with Cloud Computing- Storage, backup, and recovery of data Delivery of software on demand Development of new applications and services Streaming videos and audio 1. Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS )- It is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized hardware like servers, storage, and networks over the internet. It allows businesses to rent infrastructure on a pay-as-you-go basis, eliminating the need to buy and maintain physical hardware. IaaS is highly scalable, flexible, and cost-effective, making it ideal for hosting websites, running applications, and creating development environments. platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

It enables a serverless architecture, automatically scaling resources based on demand and charging only for the execution time of the code. FaaS simplifies development, reduces costs, and is ideal for microservices or event-driven applications. An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It acts as an identifier, enabling devices to locate and communicate with each other over the internet. Types of IP Addresses: 1.  IPv4: A 32-bit address format (e.g., 192.168.1.1). 2.  IPv6: A 128-bit address format designed to replace IPv4 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

It routes data from a local network to an external one, like the internet. In home networks, a router often acts as the gateway, forwarding data requests from devices to the internet. Gateways help manage traffic and DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the internet. It acts like a phonebook for the internet, allowing users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses. When you enter a website's domain name, DNS servers find the corresponding IP address and direct your browser to the correct site.",
